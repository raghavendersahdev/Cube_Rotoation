# Cube_Rotoation

This repository contains simple cube rotations and translations using the openGL and the MRPT api <br/>
To run the code follow the instructions:

```
  $ cd PROJECT_DIR
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make 
```

* for translations use the following keys:  <br/>
a,d = move the cube along along +/- x axis  <br/>
z,x = move the cube along along +/- y axis  <br/>
w,s = move the cube along along +/- z axis  <br/>

* for rotations, use the following keys:

4, 6 : roll (increase, decrease)  <br/>
8, 2 : pitch (increase, decrease) <br/>
1, 2 : yaw (increase, decrease)   <br/>
