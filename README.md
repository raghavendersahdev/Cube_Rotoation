# Cube_Rotoation

This repository contains simple cube rotations and translations using the openGL and the MRPT api
* To run the code follow the instructions:

...
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make 
...

* for translations use the following keys:
a,d = move the cube along along +/- x axis
z,x = move the cube along along +/- y axis
w,s = move the cube along along +/- z axis

* for rotations, use the following keys:

4, 6 : roll (increase, decrease)
8, 2 : pitch (increase, decrease)
1, 2 : yaw (increase, decrease)
